# Old_Person_Translator
  This is a simple Translator used to get a better understanding of Binary Trees(AVL) 
  Initially the user is a given 5 options:
  a. translate sentence
  b. find acronym
  c. add an acronym and definition 
  d. print tree 
  q. quit --> to quit anytime during the process
  
  This is done by going to through the database file to find the the acronym-sentence pair. File: https://github.com/nafisama/Old_Person_Translator/blob/main/abbr.txt
  This file is initially sorted as Binary tree (AVL) based on the Acronymn values, and then the translator starts taking user inputs.
  
  The main reasoning behind this app is to better grasp different methods of sorting and updating AVL trees.
  We have tried, 4 ways of sorting and updating the tree. The results are attached to this project.
